# WeatherReport
1) Under the Page Objects folder we will be having the PO files which will be used for specifying the element locators only.
2) Under the Base folder we have created 4 different files
 a) Utilities.py for performing different operations like click on element, send keystrokes, wait for element to be visible,etc.
 b) WebDriver.py for launching the browser on the basis of desired input from the user.
 c) WeatherReport.py for finding out the city for which temperature needs to be found and finding out the temperature & humidity.
 d) Weather_API.py for fetching the temperature and humidity from the API.
3) Under the TEst Suite folder we have the test case file where we are calling the different functions defined.
4) Also we have defined a configTest.py file for defining the scope for the functions.
